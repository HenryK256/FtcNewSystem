## FTC Replay System
Created by alumn for FTC teams 23545 and 10243.

These files belong in the TeamCode folder for the robot controller. These files provide a template where code can be placed to allow teams to record and replay sets of movements. 

Two different recordings can be made, a RED recording and a BLUE recording. The options for saving these files can be changed at the bottom of RecordOpMode, but by default, Share + Y is done to save a red recording and Share + X is done to save a blue recording. On the widely used Logitech F310, the share button is labeled as BACK. When recording, **do not stop the OpMode on the driver hub**, the program will automatically stop when the file is saved.
